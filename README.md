**ID Card Generator Project in Java**

This Java project, divided into two packages - Project1 and Project2, facilitates the generation, printing, and updating of student ID cards. In Project1, files like `Final.java`, `Part1.java`, `Part2.java`, `Part3.java`, and `Part5.java` work together to manage student information and ID card generation. Project2, consisting of `File1.java`, `File2.java`, and `File3.java`, handles file operations.

**Key Features:**
1. **User Input:** Capture student details using the Scanner class.
2. **ID Card Generation:** Utilizes encapsulation and error handling to print student ID cards.
3. **Information Update:** Allows updating of student information.
4. **File Handling:** Implements Java's file handling for storing and retrieving data.
5. **Ease of Use:** Simply install Eclipse, create two packages (Project1 and Project2) in the 'src' directory, place the files in the respective packages, and run `Final.java`.
6. **Folder Creation:** Users need to create a designated folder at a specified location to store generated files.

**Technology Used:**
- **Java:** Leveraging core Java concepts for robust development.
- **File Handling:** Utilizes Java's file I/O for storing and retrieving data.
- **Encapsulation:** Organizes code into classes and packages for better modularity.
- **Error Handling:** Implements error handling mechanisms for a more resilient application.
- **Scanner Class:** Incorporates the Scanner class for user input.

**How to Run:**
1. Install Eclipse IDE.
2. Create two packages (Project1 and Project2) in the 'src' directory.
3. Place the corresponding Java files into their respective packages.
4. Run `Final.java` to execute the ID card generation system.

Enhance your understanding of Java programming, file handling, and encapsulation with this practical ID Card Generator project. Feel free to customize and extend the project to suit your specific requirements. Happy coding! ðŸš€ðŸ“„
